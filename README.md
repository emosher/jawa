jawa - Just Another Web Application  
====

This app is the code outlined in my presentation on MVC using AngularJS.  

You can see a demo of the app at each stage at http://emosher.github.io/jawa/. 

**To see the code outlined in each step, view the `gh-pages` branch. I will be updating the master branch later with tests for the final version of the app, as well as Bower and Grunt integration.**

The app displays information about FOSS projects. Angular provides structure to our frontend JavaScript code as well as abstractions for common single page webapp functionality.

Steps in creating this app, with previews of each phase:
 - ng-app, data binding, and the app skeleton 
 - ng-repeat with controller, app module
 - load data with $http
 - ng-view and routing with ngRoute
 - Library usage with Showdown.js and btf-markdown directive
