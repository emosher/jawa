jawa - Just Another Web Application  
====

This app is the code outlined in my presentation on MVC using AngularJS.  

The app displays information about FOSS projects. Angular provides structure to our frontend JavaScript code as well as abstractions for common single page webapp functionality.

Steps in creating this app, with previews of each phase:
 - ng-app, data binding, and the app skeleton 
 - ng-repeat with controller, app module
 - load data with $http
 - ng-view and routing with ngRoute
 - Library usage with Showdown.js and btf-markdown directive
